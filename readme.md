# VxLib

A small framework. For now used to easily open a window and get input from the os.
Work in progress!!!

# VxProjectHelper
You can use [vxprojecthelper](https://gist.github.com/BlackHole00/85605a78d123acdf04d4f86a81913efd) to create a project. You still need git and cmake to use this tool.

Once you have the file it is possible to run `./vxprojecthelper.py init <folder>` to get started.
